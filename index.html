    <h2>Project Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>N-Gram Project
            <p>
                Built a program in JAVA that would read a large text file and will ask 
                the user the “n-gram length”, in this case words and the minimum frequency 
                that was repeated in the file. The results will print a list of all the 
                matches found in the file and the number of times it was repeated.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>BridgeCard Game
            <p>
                Built a game that would generate 13 playing cards to 4 different players 
                and then will display the results side by side for each player to determine 
                who was the winner. Used Graphical User Interface in Java to display the 
                cards and results for a better visual representation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Palindrome Project
            <p>
                Used Python build a program to import a text file or get a long string to 
                output all the matching words that would be considered to be palindrome. 
                Along with the number of times that specific word was repeated in the 
                paragraph/file.
